# Learning to Detect Multi-Modal Grasps for Dexterous Grasping in Dense Clutter

This paper is under review at ICRA 2021.

# Drake Controller & Model: Robotiq 3-Finger Adaptive Gripper

My implementation of a hybrid controller for Robotiq's 3-Finger Adapative gripper is available [here](https://github.com/mattcorsaro1/drake/tree/robotiq_3f/examples/robotiq_3f). The underlying hybrid model is described in [Technical Report: Use of Hybrid Systems to Model the Robotiq Adaptive Gripper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giulia_Franchi2/publication/278158284_Use_of_Hybrid_Systems_to_model_the_RobotiQ_Adaptive_Gripper/links/557ca3a708aec87640db4f0d/Use-of-Hybrid-Systems-to-model-the-RobotiQ-Adaptive-Gripper.pdf).

# Kuka iiwa Interface

[Ben Abbatematteo](https://babbatem.github.io/) and I developed the [kuka_brown repository](https://github.com/h2r/kuka_brown). kuka_brown contains all the code required to control our lab's Kuka LBR iiwa robot arm, Robotiq 3-Finger Adaptive Gripper, and various depth sensors.

# Grasp Pose Detection in Dense Clutter with a UR5

As a master's student at Northeastern, I ported [High Precision Grasp Pose Detection in Dense Clutter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7759114) to our UR5 arm with a Robotiq parallel-jaw gripper and worked on various improvements to increase the grasp success rate.
