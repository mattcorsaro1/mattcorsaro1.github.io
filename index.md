      I am now a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Soft Robotics, Inc.
      <br>
      <br>

  My Ph.D. dissertation is available <a href="{% link /assets/files/corsaro_dissertation.pdf %}"> here</a>.
  <br>
  <br>

  I design algorithms that enable robots to intelligently grasp objects and manipulate the world around them. I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis, Learning Task-Specific Grasps, in August 2022 at Brown University. I worked in the Intelligent Robot Lab, advised by Professor George Konidaris.

  <br>
  During summer 2021, I had the pleasure of interning at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories as a Robot Research Science Intern under the direction of Dr. Radu Corcodel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prior to joining Brown, I completed an M.S. in computer science at Northeastern University, advised by Robert Platt. I received a B.S. in electrical engineering from RPI. I also spent a summer in Robert Howe's Biorobotics Lab at Harvard University, two summers at Locus Robotics, and a summer at Vecna Technologies.
